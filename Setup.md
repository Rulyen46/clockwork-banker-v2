# Clockwork Banker: Local Setup and Run Instructions

This guide will walk you through the steps to get Clockwork Banker up and running on your local machine.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Python 3.x**: (Specify your required Python version, e.g., Python 3.8 or newer)
    * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
* **(Optional but Recommended) virtualenv or venv**: For creating isolated Python environments.
    * `pip install virtualenv` (if not using Python's built-in `venv`)

## Step-by-Step Setup

Follow these instructions to get Clockwork Banker ready on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to get a copy of the project files to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/clockwork-banker.git](https://github.com/your-username/clockwork-banker.git)
cd clockwork-banker

Note: Replace your-username with the actual GitHub username where the clockwork-banker repository is hosted.
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects you might have.
Bash

# Create a virtual environment (named 'venv' for example)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows (PowerShell):
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

You should see (venv) prepended to your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.
3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment active, install all the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter issues, ensure your pip version is up to date: pip install --upgrade pip.
4. (Optional) Database Setup / Configuration

    If Clockwork Banker uses a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL):
        SQLite (File-based, usually no extra setup): If using SQLite, the database file will likely be created automatically on first run or by a specific command.
            Example: "No specific setup required for SQLite, the clockwork_banker.db file will be created in the project root."
        Other Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.):
            "Ensure you have a PostgreSQL/MySQL server running."
            "Create a new database for Clockwork Banker:"
            SQL

            -- Example for PostgreSQL
            CREATE DATABASE clockwork_banker_db;
            CREATE USER clockwork_banker_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE clockwork_banker_db TO clockwork_banker_user;

            "Update the database connection string in config.py (or similar file). See 'Configuration' below."

    If Clockwork Banker uses environment variables for sensitive info:
        "Create a .env file in the project root (if not already present). This file should contain environment variables required by the application."
        Example .env content:

        DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///clockwork_banker.db
        # Or for PostgreSQL:
        # DATABASE_URL=postgresql://clockwork_banker_user:your_secure_password@localhost:5432/clockwork_banker_db

        # Any other API keys or sensitive settings
        API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE=your_api_key_here

        Note: The .env file should not be committed to Git (it's usually excluded by .gitignore).

5. Configuration

Review and adjust any necessary configuration settings.

    config.py (or similar file like settings.py):
        "Open config.py in your preferred code editor."
        "Adjust parameters such as DATA_FILE_PATH, LOG_LEVEL, or database connection details if they aren't handled by environment variables."
        Example:
        Python

        # config.py
        DEBUG = True
        DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///data/clockwork_banker.db" # Or use os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
        # ... other settings

6. Run Database Migrations (if applicable)

If Clockwork Banker uses an ORM (like SQLAlchemy with Alembic, or Django ORM), you'll need to apply database migrations.
Bash

# Example for Alembic (SQLAlchemy migrations)
alembic upgrade head

# Example for Django
python manage.py migrate

# Example for Flask-Migrate
flask db upgrade

7. Run the Application

Now you're ready to start Clockwork Banker!
Bash

# Example: If it's a Python script
python main.py

# Example: If it's a Flask application
# Set FLASK_APP environment variable if not already done
# export FLASK_APP=app.py # On macOS/Linux
# $env:FLASK_APP="app.py" # On Windows PowerShell
flask run

# Example: If it's a Django application
python manage.py runserver

8. Access Clockwork Banker

    If it's a web application:
        "Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the port specified in your configuration)."
    If it's a command-line tool:
        "The output will appear directly in your terminal."
        Example: "Run python main.py --help to see available commands."

Troubleshooting

    ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure you've activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Database Connection Errors: Double-check your database configuration (connection string, credentials) in config.py or your .env file. Ensure the database server is running.
    Port Already in Use: If running a web app, another process might be using the default port (e.g., 5000). You might need to change the port in your config.py or run command.
    Permission Denied: Check file permissions, especially if the application needs to write files (like a SQLite database file or logs).
